    Ever since I was little, I really loved shopping, and still do. I have a thing for by-hand works of art, unique designs, and real materials, you know..
    not plastic, and I really have a thing for the smell of leather. I am a one-woman show but please feel free to have a gander for some of my personal designs
    made as I go, all by hand and all made by: me! Thanks for stopping in!
