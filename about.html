    I have a thing for handmade works of art, unique designs, and real materials, you know..
    not plastic, and I really have a thing for the smell of leather, so I'm sharing some of my crafts.
    I am a one-woman show but please feel free to have a gander for some of my personal designs
    made as I go, all made by hand and all made by: me! Thanks for dropping by!
